          Maybe it’s because the train got cancelled on the way to work or it instantly starts raining cats and dogs as soon as you step out for the first time looking half decent after COVID-19. I understand the struggle, SouthEastern Railway and British Weather can be a joke. These are external things, but what internal things have made you say it? Maybe it’s my depression has gotten me muting group chats, while I’m making excuses of why I don’t want to meet up, or my anxiety is skyrocketing as Boris Johnson is making a decision to ease lockdown. I can’t seem to catch a break from my incessant thinking. Don’t you feel like it’s time to say, enough is enough? Our thoughts are created by the ego. Our thoughts do not define us. Our thoughts are not us. It’s time to stop being a slave to our mind.
